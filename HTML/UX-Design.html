                <h2 class="poppins-regular">Project Scope</h2>
                <p class="poppins-light">My team was assigned to design and develop an interactive prototype for a hotel
                    website. Languages used include HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS).
                </p>

                <h2 class="poppins-regular">Role and Solution</h2>
                <p class="poppins-light">As the team leader of this project, I was responsible for delegating the work
                    in the group, ensuring work gets done by the deadline. It was decided that I would be working on the
                    Home and Events webpages, followed by the top
                    navigation, menu and footer of the website.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="poppins-light">To build a hotel website which is capable of capturing the attention of viewers
                    and encouraging them to visit the hotel, guidelines relating to UX design have to be considered,
                    such as Nielsen Norman's 10 Usability Heuristics, the 7 UX Design Principles, amongst others.

                    <h2 class="poppins-regular">Work Process</h2>
                    <p class="poppins-light">As a student who had limited experience in website building via code, I had
                        to
                        learn on the go. While the learning process was arduous, with many trial-and-errors, I managed
                        to
                        pick up essential skills relating to HTML, CSS and JS, and implement them with UX (User
                        Experience)
                        design theories to build a fantastic hotel website.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="poppins-light">Here is the general flow which my team used in building our webpages:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ol class="poppins-light">
                        <li>Decide on purpose of webpage</li>
                        <li>Note down UX theories which can be used</li>
                        <li>Develop wireframe of prototype</li>
                        <li>Coding of webpage with UX in mind</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p class="poppins-light">After the webpages were completed, integration had to be done, where the
                        webpages were merged together in a single directory. This includes the modification of codes to
                        ensure the webpages were compatible with one another.
