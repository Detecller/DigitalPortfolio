                <p class="poppins-light">
                    With increased climate change driven by unsustainable practices, Singapore must do
                    its best to cultivate sustainable habits in all aspects of its system. As such, the Singapore
                    Green Plan 2030 came to be, aimed at advancing Singapore’s national agenda on
                    sustainable development.

                <p class="poppins-light">
                    My team's goal in this project is to determine
                    whether the hypothesis “Singapore is committed to implementing a sustainable future.” is true.

                <p class="poppins-light">
                    My team created a visualisation report regarding Singapore's efforts in sustainable development to
                    enable our stakeholders know more on Singapore's sustainability development. I was assigned to work
                    on data relating to Sustainable Living - one of the aspects of the Green Plan.

                <p class="poppins-light">
                    When creating a visualisation report, it is essential to determine its main target audience and
                    their needs. As such, we started by researching on our respective Green Pillars to gain insights on
                    the possible questions we may ask sustainability-related stakeholders. Afterwards, the questions
                    were sent out, either via surveys or interviews.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="poppins-light">
                    After obtaining the relevent business requirements, we collected various datasets, which are then
                    used in the data cleaning and data visualisation process. A report was written to provide an
                    analysis on the visuals created, including conclusions made by each team member.

                    <p class="poppins-light">Here is the flow of the project:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ol class="poppins-light">
                        <li>Research and listing of possible datasets</li>
                        <li>Conduct surveys + interviews</li>
                        <li>Data preparation, either in Excel or Power BI</li>
                        <li>Modelling in Power BI</li>
                        <li>Create visuals</li>

                    <br>
                    <p class="poppins-light">
                        Afterwards, the visuals had to be integrated into a single Power BI Report. As such, my team set
                        time slots for each member to load their visuals into the main PBIX file. We helped one another
                        by improving one another's visuals when needed.

                    Unfortunately, I do not have Power BI Pro/Premium, which would have enabled me to give viewers a
                    preview of the Power BI report. A download option is made available in GitHub to make up for this
                    inadequacy.
